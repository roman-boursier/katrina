As part of our study project, we would like to use a model of Deep Learning, to produce a capable rendering engineto adopt a typical stylisation such as Chinese painting. In a first time, it will propose a model of abstraction of the paintings
selected as a learning base and to use the couple painting original / abstraction for the drive. Subsequently, a motor abstractions rendering will be connected to the deep network that will produce a painting on the basis of abstraction.
The model generated will have to adopt the chosen stylisation but also interpret the original abstraction.
